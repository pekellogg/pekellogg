Hi, Iâ€™m Peyton. ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for browsing my readme!
<br>
<br>
Iâ€™m interested in full-stack software development, data analysis and how technology can accelerate the closing of equity gaps and make our lives easier.
<br>
ðŸŒ± I am a recent Flatiron School Software Engineering graduate. PRs on any of my pinned projects are welcomed and appreciated.
<br>
:technologist: Iâ€™m looking to collaborate and build upon my personal network of developers and recruiters in tech.

Please feel free to reach me by email with software development roles or opportunities.
