👋 Hi, I’m Peyton
<br>
👀 I’m interested in full-stack software development, data analysis and how technology can accelerate the closing of equity gaps and make our lives easier.
<br>
🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamentals of full-stack software engineering through curriculum projects at Flatiron School.
<br>
    ---> see my pinned repos!
<br>
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate and build upon my personal network of developers and recruiters in tech.
<br>
